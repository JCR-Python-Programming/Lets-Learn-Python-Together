# Here is how I am trying to understand what threading
# is all about. It seems as if each def function runs each
# threaded instruction starting from the top downward
# on each of the def function's instructions. The delay(n)
# function shows how the threads work, as if looking at
# them in a slow motion time lapse to show how they work
# with each def function call thread. Threading gives the
# illusion that each of the four def funtions are running at
# the same time, when really, they aren't.
